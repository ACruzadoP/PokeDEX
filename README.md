This app will be used to follow a step by step guide on how to create a Pokedex using React.

The link to the guide is the following one:

As a side note, the app will be using an API called PokeAPI and the following stuff had to be installed:

npm install bootstrap
npm install styled-components
npm install axios
npm install react-router-dom

With that said, I will create my own PokeDEX afterwards, something a lot easier as this one is extremely complex and I don't see myself creating something so difficult just for fun.
